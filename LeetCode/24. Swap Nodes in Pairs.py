"""
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.


Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]
Example 2:

Input: head = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 100


Follow up: Can you solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes? (i.e., Only nodes themselves may be changed.)
